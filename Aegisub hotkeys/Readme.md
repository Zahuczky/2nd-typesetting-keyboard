# Premade Aegisub hotkeys. 
- Some of the macros require these exact bindings, but you can modify them to your hearts content.

## Instructions
- Make a backup of your own `hotkeys.json` file in `....AppData\Roaming\Aegisub` folder
- Put this in it's place.
- These hotkeys don't interfere with any default Aegisub or Windows hotkeys, but probably differs form yours if you already have hotkeys. Examine it throughly if you plan to add your already existing hotkeys to this.
